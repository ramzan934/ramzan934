# 🏗 HOW I BUILD ML SYSTEMS

• Data ingestion & validation pipelines  
• Automated feature engineering workflows  
• Distributed training orchestration  
• Experiment tracking & reproducibility  
• Hyperparameter optimization  
• Model registry & CI/CD integration  
• Low-latency inference APIs  
• Monitoring, drift detection & retraining  

Machine learning is not complete until it is deployed, observable, and scalable.
